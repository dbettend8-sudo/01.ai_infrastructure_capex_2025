# Sources & Methodology – AI Infrastructure CapEx by Region (approx. 2025)

This document outlines the sources used to compile the approximate capital expenditure figures for AI/data-center infrastructure in the US, Europe, and China.  
Figures are **order-of-magnitude estimates** intended for comparative purposes.

| Region  | Companies / Sources | Value (USD B) | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| **US** | Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta | ~315 | Sum of 2025 CapEx guidance/estimates as reported in Q2–Q3 2024 earnings calls, investor relations materials, and industry analysis ([Lucidity Insights](https://lucidityinsights.com/articles/ai-infrastructure-hyperscalers-2025-capex-outlook)). |
| **Europe** | European Union (EU AI Gigafactory Fund) | ~21 | Based on EU proposal for a €20 B fund to develop AI “gigafactories” and cloud/compute capacity ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jul/24/eu-ai-gigafactory-fund)). Converted to USD using EUR→USD ≈ 1.05. |
| **China** | Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent | ~7 | Derived from reported ¥50 B (~US$7 B) combined AI chip & data-center investment during H1 2024 ([Flanders-China Chamber of Commerce](https://www.flanders-china.be/en/news/baidu-alibaba-tencent-invest-ai)). Assumes similar pace for 2025. |

## **Notes & Caveats**
- US numbers aggregate **only four major hyperscalers**; other players (Oracle, Apple, Nvidia) are excluded due to lack of clear AI/DC breakdown.
- European figure reflects **public sector initiative only**; it does **not** capture private spending by companies like SAP or OVHcloud.
- Chinese figure is an **annualized extrapolation** from a half-year report; actual 2025 spend could be higher or lower.
- Currency conversions rounded to nearest whole billion USD.

## **Suggested Updates**
If you wish to refine these numbers:
1. **Replace placeholders** with actual figures from Q4 2024 or FY2025 filings.
2. **Adjust currency rates** to current values.
3. **Add missing companies** in each region for a fuller picture.
